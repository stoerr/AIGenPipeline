# Application for "differential retranslation"

This is a copy of the mini app
https://github.com/stoerr/AIGenPipeline/tree/develop/examples/differentialReTranslation
that has been completely done by AI, without me writing a single line of code.
Admittedly, that was a bit of work to do it that way, especially being the first time of that kind of application
with this framework. :-)

BTW: This is a demonstration for a proposed feature for the automatic translation proof of concept of the
[Composum AI](https://github.com/ist-dresden/composum-AI).
(OK, I edited the texts a bit since that is deployed as a demonstration, and those aren't good enough for that.)
