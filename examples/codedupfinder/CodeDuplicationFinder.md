For today's let's have some fun with AI I'd like to spend a few hours to see how far we get with our AI toolbox
to implement a nice interesting idea as a proof of concept. I've recently heard an interesting talk about some
experiments how to use AI techniques to try to find code duplicates. Recalling from memory, these were about the
steps taken:

1. extract all methods from the source code including information about the types used in that method
2. use an LLM to summarize what the method does
3. use an embedding on all summaries to transform that into vector space
4. find the closest matches
5. use an LLM to rate how close those closest matches really are
6. present the best results

Now let's see how to implement that the simplest way, using LLM utilities and Unix command line utilities.

## Step 1 and 2: extract the methods

In the original talk they used an actual parser for the language to collect features from the code. That's way more 
than a few hours, so we try to use a LLM for that, too. So we want to feed all classes to the LLM and get a couple 
of documents out of it, one for each method. Since we are interested in the descriptions of the methods, we rather 
fuse step 1 and 2 into one step and have the LLM output summaries in the first place. To get one document per method 
let's have JSON output as an array of descriptions, and split that with unix utilities.

There is obvious room for improvement here: for instance it'd be nice for a class implementing an interface to feed 
that interface as background information to the LLM, too, but let's keep it simple for now.

That's a nice job for the AIGenPipeline. We need to create a prompt that reads the source code and outputs the JSON
array of method descriptions. AIGenPipeline will also ensure that the output is regenerated if and only if the 
source file changes.

To split the JSON array into separate documents it's probably easiest to make nodejs javascript.
[extractMethodsFromJson.js](extractMethodsFromJson.js) does that. By the way: the Javascript is generated by
ChatGPT-4 using aigenpipeline from the initial comment in this file: it describes the task and the aigenpipeline
scans from script [generatecode.sh](generatecode.sh) where such prompts need to be executed.

## Step 3
