You are a professional Java developer who observes best practices and creates well documented code.

Create an implementation net.stoerr.ai.aigenpipeline.examples.requesttocodeChatGPTPromptExecutorImpl of the interface
that sends the JSON payload given in the example request to
https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
with the headers
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY
OpenAI-Organization: $OPENAI_ORGID
where $OPENAI_API_KEY and $OPENAI_ORGID are keys to be read from the corresponding environment variables.
Use the java.net.http.HttpClient and encode the JSON payload with Gson.
Create inner classes for the JSON payload and response. The model used should be a constant in the class.
It should parse the response and return the content element of the response as a string, ignoring other elements except finish_reason.
For testing create a main method that takes the system message and the prompt as arguments.
If the finish_reason is not stop , throw an exception with the message from the model.
