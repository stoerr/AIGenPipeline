# Prompts that have been used in the project

This is a record for myself for some interesting prompts that I have used in the project - usually for
ChatGPT with the [Co-Developer GPT engine](https://CoDeveloperGPTengine.stoerr.net/) .

## General introductory prompt (.chatgpt.intro.md)

Read the .chatgpt.codeRules.md and observe the rules that
are laid out there during this whole chat, but you don't need to repeat them.

List all files.

Use the grep operation to search for comments starting with `ChatGPTTask:` and execute them. The comment should be
replaced by the new code or deleted when it's completely done.

## Generate first version

Read the .chatgpt.codeRules.md and observe the rules that
are laid out there during this whole chat, but you don't need to repeat them.

Read the README.md and the Implementation.md, list all files in the project, determine what needs to be done to
generate a rough frame for the project. Do not generate any code except the main class for the command line,
it should for now just print the usage. Do generate the maven modules and run the build action to make sure it works.

Before doing anything list the files to make sure it hasn't been done already, and continue from there writing the
necessary files yourself and execute the build action afterwards.

## Fix / build loop

Diagnose the problems, re-read the problematic files, fix the problems and execute the build action, until the build works.
You do not need to ask me whether to continue - just do what's necessary yourself.
