# Todos for the application

## Command line / framework improvements
- prompt on command line? stdin? unclear what filename!
  - (idea: -p - = stdin , versioning from tag)
- variables for placeholders on command line? unclear for versioning
- makefile-modus : regenerate when older
- only when not existant modus
- number of tokens for output configurable

## Site improvements

- examples
  - json prompts to page
  - Request example to GSON class
  - construct the readmes of the examples?
  - HTL to md to java?
  - construct mini-application?
